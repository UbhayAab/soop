// no network.
//
// WHY this exists. Without it, a cold start with no signal is worse than a blank
// screen: `api.table()` returns [] on error and `tryRpc` never throws, so
// `loadSpaces()` comes back empty, no active workspace is found, and the shell
// renders "You are not in a Space yet. Create one with + on the left, or open an
// invite link." To a volunteer standing in a village with no bars that reads as
// "I have been removed from my organisation" - not as "you are offline". The
// service worker caches the shell correctly, so the app opens and then lies
// about the account.
//
// So: remember the body of a handful of read-only calls - the bootstrap blob,
// the space list, the last page of a channel - and hand the same bytes back when
// the network is gone. Reads only. A write is never replayed from here; that is
// the outbox's job and it is deliberately a different mechanism.
//
// The key carries the signed-in user id, so a second person signing in on a
// shared phone can never be served the first person's Space list.
