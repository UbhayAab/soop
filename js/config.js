// in a file with no auth on it, and nothing in the client ever imported it - the
// behaviour it once enabled was removed in "No more blank screen: an account
// with no team gets a real screen with a join box instead of being dumped into
// the 1770-member demo Space".

//
// CODE_SIGNIN also controls account CREATION, not just the button: requesting a
// code ran signInWithOtp with shouldCreateUser, so asking for one conjured a
// real account with no password and no Space.
//

// ------------------------------------------------------------------ embedding

// its own origin in the iframe src and js/embed.js refuses to start unless that
// value appears here, so this list is the whole answer to "who may drive this
// panel and receive its messages".
//
// A leading '*.' matches subdomains of that host on the same scheme and port,
// and nothing else. There is deliberately no bare '*': "any page may embed us"
// is not a state anybody should be able to reach by editing one character.
//
// This is an allowlist, not a secret, which is why it can live in the client.
// It is also only half the defence. A browser will still LOAD the app in a frame
// on any page; what this stops is Dek talking to it or accepting credentials
// from it. Serving `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors <the same list>`
// from wherever this is hosted is what stops the frame being drawn at all, and
// it is the one that also stops clickjacking. GitHub Pages cannot set headers,
// so on Pages this list is the only enforcement there is.

// handed their credentials. originAllowed also exempts localhost from the https
